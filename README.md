# Customer-Segmentation
What is it all about ?

These days, you can personalize everything. There’s no one-size-fits-all approach. But, for business, this is actually a great thing. It creates a lot of space for healthy competition and opportunities for companies to get creative about how they acquire and retain customers.

One of the fundamental steps towards better personalization is customer segmentation. This is where personalization starts, and proper segmentation will help you make decisions regarding new features, new products, pricing, marketing strategies, even things like in-app recommendations.

But, doing segmentation manually can be exhausting. Why not employ machine learning to do it for us? In this article, I’ll tell you how to do just that.

Advantages of customer segmentation

Implementing customer segmentation leads to plenty of new business opportunities. You can do a lot of optimization in:

budgeting, 
product design, 
promotion, 
marketing, 
customer satisfaction. 
Let’s discuss these benefits in more depth.

Budgeting
Nobody likes to invest in campaigns that don’t generate any new customers. Most companies don’t have huge marketing budgets, so that money has to be spent right. Segmentation enables you to target customers with the highest potential value first, so you get the most out of your marketing budget. 

Product design
Customer segmentation helps you understand what your users need. You can identify the most active users/customers, and optimize your application/offer towards their needs. 

Promotion
Properly implemented customer segmentation helps you plan special offers and deals. Frequent deals have become a staple of e-commerce and commercial software in the past few years. If you reach a customer with just the right offer, at the right time, there’s a huge chance they’re going to buy. Customer segmentation will help you tailor your special offers perfectly.

Marketing
The marketing strategy can be directly improved with segmentation because you can plan personalized marketing campaigns for different customer segments, using the channels that they use the most.

Customer satisfaction
By studying different customer groups, you learn what they value the most about your company. This information will help you create personalized products and services that perfectly fit your customers’ preferences.

 why machine learning for customer segmentation.

Machine Learning for customer segmentation
Machine learning methodologies are a great tool for analyzing customer data and finding insights and patterns. Artificially intelligent models are powerful tools for decision-makers. They can precisely identify customer segments, which is much harder to do manually or with conventional analytical methods.

There are many machine learning algorithms, each suitable for a specific type of problem. One very common machine learning algorithm that’s suitable for customer segmentation problems is the k-means clustering algorithm. There are other clustering algorithms as well such as DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering, and BIRCH, etc.

Why  I am implement machine learning for customer segmentation?

More time
Manual customer segmentation is time-consuming. It takes months, even years to analyze piles of data and find patterns manually.  Also if done heuristically, it may not have the accuracy to be useful as expected.

Customer segmentation used to be done manually and wasn’t too precise. You’d manually create and populating different data tables, and analyze the data like a detective with a looking glass. Now, it’s much better (and relatively easy thanks to rapid progress in ML) to just use machine learning, which can free up your time to focus on more demanding problems that require creativity to solve.

Ease of retraining
Customer Segmentation is not a “develop once and use forever” type of project. Data is ever-changing, trends oscillate, everything keeps changing after your model is deployed. Usually, more labeled data becomes available after development, and it’s a great resource for improving the overall performance of your model. 


Higher accuracy
The value of an optimal number of clusters for given customer data is easy to find using machine learning methods like the elbow method. Not only the optimal number of clusters but also the performance of the model is far better when we use machine learning.

outcomes

It’s not wise to serve all customers with the same product model, email, text message campaign, or ad. Customers have different needs. A one-size-for-all approach to business will generally result in less engagement, lower-click through rates, and ultimately fewer sales. Customer segmentation is the cure for this problem.

Finding an optimal number of unique customer groups will help us understand how your customers differ, and help us to  give them exactly what they want. Customer segmentation improves customer experience and boosts company revenue. That’s why segmentation is a must if you want to surpass your competitors and get more customers. Doing it with machine learning is definitely the right way to go.
